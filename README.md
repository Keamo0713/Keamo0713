Hello, World! ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm Keamogetsoe Kgomotso Nicole Sele
A resilient developer specializing in AI and full-stack solutions.

ðŸš€ About MeMy journey into software development has been a winding road, shaped by resilience and a relentless pursuit of passion. Originally set on a path toward law, I found my true calling in code and UX/UI design. Lifeâ€™s challenges led me to explore entrepreneurship in real estate and event coordination, where I honed skills in project management, negotiation, and communication. Today, Iâ€™m an enthusiastic developer with a Diploma in Software Development, currently diving deep into an AI Bootcamp at Capaciti and pursuing the IBM Full Stack Software Developer Professional Certificate.  
Iâ€™m an eternal learner, fascinated by how things workâ€”whether itâ€™s the logic of an algorithm or the mechanics of a car. My unique blend of technical expertise and human-centric skills fuels my passion for building functional, intuitive, and user-focused solutions.
