Hello, World! Keamogetsoe Kgomotso Nicole Sele 👋

A resilient developer specializing in AI and full-stack solutions.

🚀 About Me
My journey into software development has been anything but linear, shaped by resilience and an unyielding drive to find my true passion. After a pivotal detour from law, I discovered my calling in code and UX/UI. While unforeseen challenges forced a pause, my entrepreneurial spirit led me to ventures in real estate and event coordination, where I honed invaluable skills in project management, negotiation, and communication.

Today, I am an enthusiastic developer with a diploma in Software Development, currently immersing myself in an intensive AI Bootcamp at Capaciti and the IBM Full Stack Software Developer Professional Certificate. I am passionate about leveraging my unique blend of technical and interpersonal skills to build functional, intuitive, and user-centric solutions.

I'm an eternal learner who enjoys understanding how things work, from the logic of an algorithm to the mechanics of a car. Every step of my journey has equipped me with a unique blend of technical and human-centric skills, and I'm excited to bring creative visions to life through code.
