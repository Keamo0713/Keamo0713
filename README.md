A resilient developer specializing in AI and full-stack solutions.
🚀 About MeMy journey into software development has been a winding road, shaped by resilience and a relentless pursuit of passion. Originally set on a path toward law, I found my true calling in code and UX/UI design. Life’s challenges led me to explore entrepreneurship in real estate and event coordination, where I honed skills in project management, negotiation, and communication.
